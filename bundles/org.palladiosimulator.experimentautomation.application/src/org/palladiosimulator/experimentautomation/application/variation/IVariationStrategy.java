 * Interface for specifying variation strategies of PCM elements. For example, the population number

 * allow two things. First, a strategy must to allow to specify the element to be varied (e.g., a
 * closed workload). Second, a strategy must allow to assign a concrete value to the specified
 * element (e.g., 10 users).
 * 
 * Implementing classes are can be referenced from Experiment Automation's variation meta class. The
 * "pcm.variation" model includes such references that are used in the PCM context.
