This is an experimental workaround to allow the specification of experiments that allows a fixed pool of experiments that can be run in succession.
The Variation to use in this case is [FixedValueVariation](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-Addons-ExperimentAutomation/blob/dev-add-fixed-experiment-setup/bundles/org.palladiosimulator.experimentautomation.application/src/org/palladiosimulator/experimentautomation/application/variation/FixedValueVariation.java).
